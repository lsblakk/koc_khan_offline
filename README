This is a project for Kids on Computers to give access to Khan Academy offline

There are several tools available here:

http://www.khanacademy.org/downloads

However, the closest existing tool is designed for running a local instance of the website in
Windows (using google app engine) and so this version of the tool took the python scripts from 
http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/downloads/detail?name=KhanAcademy-1482.zip&can=2&q= and have been adapting them to

a) work with other video formats (mp4, ogg) that exist on archive.org
b) provide a command-line interface for interacting with this tool
c) create a web interface to interact with the local video storage

TODO:

* remove video_mapping.py and replace with a list of the known categories in download.py

adjust download.py:
* to read each category's url (eg: http://www.archive.org/download/KhanAcademy_Geometry) and process list of filenames in each (as requested through the command line args for -c categories)
* check if each video exists in local video/ dir before trying to download
** if not already downloaded, download each unique filename with a format that matches the requested list of formats to the video/ dir
** else, skip it
* write an index page in the top level of koc_khan_offline that displays the content of the video dir so users can interact with the videos through that

Nice to have:
* keep a list of what doesn't download (or how far the script runs until?)
* SMS if there are updates available (twilio)
* easter egg - download one monty python video :)
